Public WebRTC Framework developed in the WONDER (Webrtc interOperability tested in coNtradictive DEployment scenaRios) project featuring seamless inter-domain interoperability.

The main goal of the project is to evaluate with practical experiments how Web based service delivery mechanisms compare with IMS based service delivery mechanisms.

The second objective of the experiment is to test and investigate how interoperable the WebRTC and IMS approaches are.

The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement nÂ° 287581 - OpenLab. http://www.ict-openlab.eu/home.html
