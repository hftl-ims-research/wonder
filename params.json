{"name":"WONDER","tagline":"The Reference Implementation of Signaling On-the-Fly concept enabling seamless interoperability between different WebRTC Service Provider domains","body":"# Signalling On-the-Fly for WebRTC\r\nThe WONDER Javascript Framework was designed and implemented to address the lack of a standard WebRTC signalling protocol by implementing the novel Signalling On-the-Fly concept, enabling seamless interoperability between different WebRTC Service Provider domains. Check here all benefits WONDER may bring to WebRTC App developers and providers.\r\n# features\r\n* Multiparty Audio and Video conversations between different WebRTC domains;\r\n* Multiparty Data Channel based Chat between different WebRTC domains;\r\n* Multiparty Data Channel based File Transfer between different WebRTC domains;\r\n* Multiparty Screen Sharing between different WebRTC domains (encrypted Identity Provider Restful services is needed)\r\n* Multipart Conversation update to add additional resources e.g. to add Audio and Video to an existing text Chat only conversation\r\n* Notification of incoming Conversation invitations to users that have no WebRTC app loaded\r\n* Additional Data Channel based services by implementing the Data Codec class\r\n* Audio and Video Interoperability with SIP and IMS endpoints by using Doubango SIPML5 Gateway\r\n\r\n# Learn more about WONDER library\r\n\r\n* [The Signalling On-the-Fly Concept](https://github.com/hypercomm/wonder/wiki/Signalling-on-the-fly)\r\n* [WONDER Benefits](https://github.com/hypercomm/wonder/wiki/WONDER-Benefits)\r\n* [WONDER library overview](https://github.com/hypercomm/wonder/wiki/Overview-of-WONDER-Classes)\r\n* [WONDER API Documentation](https://raw.githack.com/hypercomm/wonder/master/docs/index.html)\r\n* WONDER App developer guide\r\n* WONDER Messaging Stub developer guide i.e. how to make a Signalling Server / Protocol compliant with WONDER library\r\n* Experimentations performed with WONDER library\r\n* Demos\r\n\r\n### Aknowledgments\r\n\r\nThe WONDER javascript framework implementation has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement nÂ° 287581 - OpenLab. http://www.ict-openlab.eu/home.html.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
