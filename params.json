{"name":"WONDER","tagline":"The Reference Implementation of Signaling On-the-Fly concept enabling seamless interoperability between different WebRTC Service Provider domains","body":"# Signalling On-the-Fly for WebRTC\r\nThe WONDER Javascript Framework was designed and implemented to address the lack of a standard WebRTC signalling protocol by implementing the novel Signalling On-the-Fly concept, enabling seamless interoperability between different WebRTC Service Provider domains. Check here all benefits WONDER may bring to WebRTC App developers and providers.\r\n\r\n# Learn more about WONDER library\r\n\r\n#### [The Signalling On-the-Fly Concept](https://github.com/hypercomm/wonder/wiki/Signalling-on-the-fly)\r\n#### [Benefits](https://github.com/hypercomm/wonder/wiki/WONDER-Benefits)\r\n#### [Library overview](https://github.com/hypercomm/wonder/wiki/Overview-of-WONDER-Classes)\r\n#### [API Documentation](https://raw.githack.com/hypercomm/wonder/master/docs/api/index.html)\r\n#### [How to develop a WONDER App](https://github.com/hypercomm/wonder/wiki/How-to-Develop-a-WONDER-App)\r\n#### [How to develop a WONDER Messaging Stub](https://github.com/hypercomm/wonder/wiki/How-to-Develop-a-Messaging-Stub)\r\nHow to make a Signalling Server / Protocol compliant with WONDER library\r\n### [Experimentations performed with WONDER library](https://github.com/hypercomm/wonder/wiki/Experimentations-performed-with-WONDER-library)\r\n\r\n## [Live Demos](https://github.com/hypercomm/wonder/wiki/Live-Demos)\r\n\r\n## [How to setup your own WONDER environment](https://github.com/hypercomm/wonder/wiki/How-to-setup-your-own-WONDER-environment)\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n* Audio and Video conversations between different WebRTC domains;\r\n* Enriched Conversations between different WebRTC domains with Screen Sharing and Data Channel based  features like Chat and file transfer;\r\n* Multiparty Conversations between different WebRTC domains;\r\n* Conversation update to add additional resources e.g. to add Audio and Video to an existing text Chat only conversation\r\n* Notification of incoming Conversation invitations to users that have no WebRTC app loaded\r\n* Additional Data Channel based services by implementing the Data Codec class\r\n* Audio and Video Interoperability with SIP and IMS endpoints by using Doubango SIPML5 Gateway\r\n\r\n### Aknowledgments\r\n\r\nThe WONDER javascript framework implementation has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement nÂ° 287581 - OpenLab. http://www.ict-openlab.eu/home.html.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
